<p>Kubernetes is a container management technology developed in Google lab to manage containerized applications in different kind of environments such as physical, virtual, and cloud infrastructure.</p>

<h1>
    Features of Kubernetes
</h1>
<p>Following are some of the important features of Kubernetes.</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Continues development, integration and deployment
    </li>
    <li>
        Containerized infrastructure
    </li>
    <li>
        Application-centric management
    </li>
    <li>
        Auto-scalable infrastructure
    </li>
    <li>
        Environment consistency across development testing and production
    </li>
    <li>
        Loosely coupled infrastructure, where each component can act as a separate unit
    </li>
    <li>
        Higher density of resource utilization
    </li>
    <li>
        Predictable infrastructure which is going to be created
    </li>
</ul>

<h1>Kubernetes - Cluster Architecture</h1>
<ul>
    <li>pod: pod is the smallest execution unit in Kubernetes. abstraction over container.
        usally one application per pod. each pod gets own ip address.
    </li>
    <li>service: Permananet ip address. lifecycle of pod and service not connected. it has 2 functionalitys. Permananet ip and load balancer </li>
    <li>ingress: API object that provides routing rules to manage external users' access to the services</li>
    <li>configMap: External config of your application. Don't put credentials in configmap </li>
    <li>secrets: used to store scecrt data. base64 encoded</li>
    <li>deployment: blue print for pods. Abstraction of pods. Dbs can't be replicated via deployment</li>
    <li>volumes: storage in local machine or outside of k8 cluster</li>
    <li>Replica: </li>
    <li>statefulset: for stateful apps. access the same volume</li>
</ul>

<h1>3 process in node</h1>
<ul>
    <li>
        container run time
    </li>
    <li>
        kubelet: interact with both container and node. it starts pod with a container inside
    </li>
    <li>
        kubeproxy: forwards the request
    </li>
</ul>

<h1>4 process in master</h1>
<ul>
    <li>API server: cluster gateway, acts as gate keeper for auth</li>
    <li>schedular: where to put the pod</li>
    <li>control manager: detect cluster state change</li>
    <li>etcd: it is a cluster brain. cluster changes get stored in key value pair. Application data not stroed in etcd</li>
</ul>

<p>production has multiple masters and nodes. it is diffcult to test our app. so we use minikube</p>
<p>minikube: master and node process run in one node</p>
<p>kubectl: enables pods to run in node.</p>

<p>installation: brew install minikube</p>

<h1>cmnds</h1>

<ul>
    <li>minikube start --vm-driver=hyperkit</li>
    <li>minikube status</li>
    <li>kubectl get nodes</li>
    <li>kubectl get pods</li>
</ul>
