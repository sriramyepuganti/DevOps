<h1>Virtual Machine</h1>
<p>It runs on top of an emulating software called the hypervisor which sit between the hardware and the virtual machine.
    The hypervisor is the key to enable virtualization. It manages the sharing of physical resources into virtual
    machines.
    Each virtual machine runs its own guest operating system. They are less agile and have low portability than
    containers.</p>
<h1>Docker</h1>
<p>Docker is a container management service. The keywords of Docker are develop, ship and run anywhere. The whole idea
    of Docker is for developers to easily develop applications, ship them into containers which can then be deployed
    anywhere.</p>

<h1>container</h1>
<p>Containers are isolated and instances of Docker images that can be run using the Docker run command. The basic
    purpose of Docker
    is to run containers.</p>

<h1>Images</h1>
<p>An image is a combination of a file system and parameters</p>

<h1>Installation</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Windows: use docker toolbox exe file</li>
    <li>linux: use curl </li>
</ul>

<h1>commands</h1>
<ul>
    <li>version: docker --version</li>
    <li>hello world: docker run hello-world</li>
    <li>images list: docker images</li>
    <li>run: docker run image_name/id</li>
    <li>interactive terminal: docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash</li>
    <li>image ids list: docker images -q</li>
    <li>inspect image config: docker inspect image_name/id</li>
    <li>remove image: docker rmi image_name/id</li>
    <li>delete container: docker rm container_id</li>
    <li>process: docker ps</li>
    <li>all process: docker ps -a</li>
    <li>history(will show all the commands that were run against the image): docker history image_id</li>
    <li>logs: docker logs container_id</li>
</ul>
